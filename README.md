## 📌 Overview

**DevTinder** is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**, similar to popular dating apps but tailored specifically for the tech community. Users can create profiles, explore suggested developers, send connection requests, and manage their matches.

This repository contains the **fully functional and scalable backend** of DevTinder. It is built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, following a **microservices** architectural pattern to ensure maintainability and future scaling.

📖 **My Node.js Learning Repository**: I learned and maintain all my core Node.js knowledge in one place: [Namsate Nodejs](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/devTinder-backend)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Framework** | **Node.js + Express.js** | Runtime environment and minimal, flexible framework for the API. |
| **Database** | **MongoDB + Mongoose** | NoSQL database and an ODM for elegant data modeling. |
| **Authentication** | **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** | Secure, state-less authentication using tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies. |
| **Encryption** | **bcryptjs** | For securely hashing and salting user passwords. |
| **Utilities** | **dotenv** | For managing environment variables securely. |
| **Testing** | **Postman** | Used for comprehensive API testing and documentation. |

## 🔑 Features Implemented

### 1. Robust Authentication System

* ✅ User **Signup, Login, and Logout** functionality.
* ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with secure cookies.
* ✅ **Password encryption** using `bcryptjs`.
* ✅ **Authentication middleware** to protect all private routes.

### 2. User Profile Management

* ✅ **View** and **Edit** user profile details (with security-restricted fields).
* ✅ Secure **Update Password** functionality with validation.

### 3. Connection Request System

* ✅ **Send** connection requests (`Interested` or `Ignored` status).
* ✅ **Accept or Reject** received requests.
* ✅ **Prevent duplicate requests** using MongoDB validation.
* ✅ **Prevent self-requests** using Mongoose `.pre` middleware.

### 4. Optimized Feed API & Pagination (The Core Feature)

* ✅ Fetches **suggested developer profiles** while intelligently excluding:
    * The logged-in user.
    * Existing connections.
    * Users with pending requests.
    * Previously `Ignored` users.
* ✅ Implemented **pagination** using `skip` & `limit` for performance.
* ✅ Optimized query using **MongoDB `$nin` and `$ne` operators**.

### 5. Database Design & Optimization

* **User Schema**: Includes sanitized input fields (`trim`, `lowercase`), unique constraints on `email` and `username`.
* **ConnectionRequest Schema**: Defines `fromUserId`, `toUserId`, and `status` with an `enum` validation.
* **Advanced Query Optimization**: Used **Indexes (`index: true`)** and **Compound Indexes** on critical fields for faster query execution.

### 6. Middleware Implementation

* **Authentication Middleware**: Ensures only authenticated users access protected resources.
* **Error Handling Middleware**: Centralized system for consistent error responses.
* **Mongoose Pre-Hook Middleware**: Custom logic to prevent self-requests before saving to the database.

## 🚀 API Endpoints

The APIs are modularly structured into separate routers (`auth`, `profile`, `connections`, `users`) for high maintainability.

| Category | Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auth** | `POST` | `/auth/signup` | Register a new user | ❌ |
| **Auth** | `POST` | `/auth/login` | Authenticate user & issue JWT | ❌ |
| **Auth** | `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Logout user by clearing JWT cookie | ✅ |
| **Profile** | `GET` | `/profile/view` | Get logged-in user profile | ✅ |
| **Profile** | `PATCH` | `/profile/edit` | Update allowed profile fields | ✅ |
| **Feed** | `GET` | `/user/feed?page=1&limit=10` | Get suggested developer profiles with pagination | ✅ |
| **Requests** | `POST` | `/request/send/:status/:toUserId` | Send a connection request (`Interested`/`Ignored`) | ✅ |
| **Requests** | `POST` | `/request/review/:status/:requestId` | Accept/Reject a received request | ✅ |
| **Requests** | `GET` | `/user/requests/received` | Fetch pending connection requests | ✅ |
| **Requests** | `GET` | `/user/connections` | Fetch accepted connections (matches) | ✅ |
